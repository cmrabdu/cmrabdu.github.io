        <h2>A Passion for Flight</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve always been fascinated by things that fly. Airplanes, machines, mechanics, the way objects move through the
          air—anything related to flight grabs my attention.
          In April 2020, when I was 14 years old, I stumbled upon a YouTube video of an FPV drone. It instantly clicked.
          The immersion, the smoothness, the speed, the freedom of movement—I was hooked.
          From that moment on, I had only one goal in mind: build one myself.
        </p>

        <h2>Self-Taught from the Ground Up</h2>
        <p>
          Of course, at 14, I didn’t have the technical skills, the experience, or the resources. But I had the drive. So,
          as I often do, I taught myself.
          I spent hours researching, reading, watching tutorials, and engaging in forums. I learned the basics of
          piloting, the components that make up a drone,
          how onboard electronics work, and the rules I needed to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started by getting a <strong>Taranis QX7</strong> radio transmitter and trained exclusively on a simulator for
          several months.
          For over six months, I flew only virtually—refining my reflexes, understanding how the drone feels, and learning
          how to configure everything—
          while saving up to afford the real thing.
        </p>

        <h2>From Theory to Practice</h2>
        <p>
          At 15, I finally had enough money to buy my first set of components. It was time to move from virtual to real.
          For the build, I followed the guidance of a French content creator, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/@AirFlexfpv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airflex</a>,
          whose tutorials and explanations were clear and detailed. I related to him—young, passionate, and technically
          sharp.
          Thanks to his content and everything I had learned, I was able to build my first racing FPV drone step by step.
        </p>


        <h2>A Transformative Project</h2>
        <p>
          This project taught me far more than just technical skills. I learned to be resourceful, to solve problems on my
          own, and to be patient and precise.
          I got hands-on with electronics, software configuration, piloting, and fine mechanics. Every step was a chance
          to discover, understand, and improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          This drone is much more than just a flying object. It represents a personal journey, a drive to learn
          independently,
          a deep interest in technology, and the desire to turn what fascinates me into something real.
