            <p><strong>Hello everyone,</strong></p>

            <p>Like many Steam Deck owners, I encountered the dreaded black screen issue…</p>

            <p>After a few months of frustration, I decided to try multiple methods found in YouTube videos to finally <strong>recover</strong> my Steam Deck and enjoy it again.</p>

            <p><strong>My Experience :</strong></p>

            <p>First, I decided to completely replace the screen (the screen <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/en-eu/products/steam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), as mine was already cracked. I thought that maybe, over time, the crack had caused the black screen issue. However, after replacing the screen, nothing worked on the built-in display. The Steam Deck was still functional on an external screen, though.</p>

            <p>That’s when I realized I had fallen victim to the infamous <strong>"Black Screen of Death"</strong> on the Steam Deck…</p>

            <p>I’ll spare you the details because I spent <strong>a lot</strong> of time testing all kinds of solutions, some more bizarre than others. But here’s what actually worked for me.</p>

            <p>This <strong>GOAT</strong> of a video saved me : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6_u5M8qnCI&t=206s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>

            <p><strong>Here’s a quick summary of the steps :</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Turn off</strong> the Steam Deck completely (<strong>hold the Power button for 15 seconds</strong>).</li>
                <li><strong>Enter recovery mode</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hold <strong>Volume -</strong>, the <strong>menu button (three dots …)</strong>, and <strong>Power</strong> at the same time.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>charging light</strong> should blink slowly.</li>
                        <li>Wait <strong>15 to 30 minutes</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Turn the Steam Deck back on</strong>—the screen should work normally.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Important :</strong> I had to <strong>repeat the process three times</strong> before my Steam Deck came back to life. On the final attempt, I waited <strong>1 hour</strong> instead of 15-30 minutes.</p>

            <p>That’s it ! Let me know if this helped. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to answer them !</p>
